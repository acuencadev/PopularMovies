# Popular Movies

Most of us can relate to kicking back on the couch and enjoying a movie with friends and family. In this project, I am building an app to allow users to discover the most popular movies playing.

## Compiling

To compile and test this app you need to add the entry MoviesApi to the /gradle.properties file. You can get a new API key from:

[The Movies API](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api)
